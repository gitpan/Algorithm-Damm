NAME
    Algorithm::Damm - Calculate the Damm error correction check digit.

SYNOPSIS
      use Algorithm::Damm qw/check_digit is_valid/;

      $c = check_digit("43881234567");
      print "It works\n" if is_valid("43881234567$c");

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements the Damm algorithm for calculating a check digit.

    You can find information about the algorithm by searching the web for
    "Damm ECC". In particular, see the "SEE ALSO" section (below).

HISTORY
    This module came about as I was reverse engineering a checksum method
    being used on another project of mine. History of the method used was
    lost to the sands of time, and I needed something to run some quick
    tests on various checksum algorithms.

    This module is a reimplementation of one of the algorithms I had tested.

FUNCTIONS
    is_valid CHECKSUMMED_NUM
        This function returns 1 if the final character of CHECKSUMMED_NUM is
        the correct checksum for the rest of the number, 0 if not, and undef
        if CHECKSUMMED_NUM contains an invalid character or does not contain
        at least two digits (one for the number, and one for the checksum).

        This function is equivalent to

          substr $N,length($N)-1 eq check_digit(substr $N,0,length($N)-1)

        Additionally, due to the way this algorithm works, if you crank the
        checksum calculation through the last digit (checkdigit included),
        you will end up with a value of 0.

    check_digit NUM
        This function returns the checksum of the given number. It will
        return undef if it is not able to calculate the checksum.

SEE ALSO
    Algorithm::CheckDigits
        Algorithm::CheckDigits is a module that this probably should have
        been written as a part of. There is an open issue
        (<https://github.com/MidLifeXis/perl-algorithm-damm/issues/1>) to
        add an integration layer for this module to Algorithm::CheckDigits.

    Math::CheckDigits
        Slightly different approach to generating check digits.
